# Recommendation-System
How to build a basic recommendation system using K Nearest Neighbors

# Data
Selected an openly available data source. There are three tables which can be downloaded [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).

From the above hyperlink you can get the data from the three tables : Ratings, Books Information & User Information.

# Algorithm Selected
K Nearest Neighbors

# Procedure
This task was not exploratory and the  goal wasn't to find the best possible solution. The sole intent was to leverage Sklearn to implement kNN algorithm on the selected dataset and recommend top 5 books based on the user ratings available in the selected data.

# Result
It is a straight forward result where the algorithm picks top 5 books based on the users ratings for any given user name !!
